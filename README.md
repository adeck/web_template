# web_template

## What is this?

A place where I keep the template for my simple web-based projects.

This assumes:

- that you have an s3 bucket setup as a static website,
- that the s3 bucket is just the domain name you're using for the site,
- that you have the appropriate keys set in your AWS environment s.t. you can write to the named bucket using boto3

## How do I use it?
